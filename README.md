# Calculator-Project
This is my second solo web project, but my first one working with JavaScript. I have made this as i learn the basics of JavaScript to see that i could. I was focused more on functionailty than the visual design so its not much to look at. However the functionailty is all there. If you find a bug please do let me know.

The calculator can perform all basic mathematical operations using multiply, add, divide, and subtraction. I did not include a clear button simply due to the layout of
the calculator.

However had i added one it would have been as simple as to wrap the entire js code into an init function and simply call it on page open and on the clear button. Thus 
resetting everything. 

HJW TO USE - 
1. Download the files. 
2. With them all in the same calculator folder simply double click index.html.
3. Enjoy.
